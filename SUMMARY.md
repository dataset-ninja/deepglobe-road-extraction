**DeepGlobe 2018 Road Extraction** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the urban planning research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the geospatial domain and environmental industry. 

The dataset consists of 8570 images with 6226 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*road*).

Images in the DeepGlobe 2018 Road Extraction dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 2344 (27% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (1101 images), *train* (6226 images), and *valid* (1243 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the Facebook, DigitalGlobe, CosmiQ Works, Wageningen University, and The MIT Media Lab.
